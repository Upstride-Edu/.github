## ðŸ’¡ About Us

Upstride Education is a social-impact learning initiative committed to bridging the digital divide by offering free, high-quality tech education to underprivileged communities. We partner with NGOs and grassroots organizations to conduct on-site workshops that teach practical skills in coding, digital literacy, and emerging technologies. By combining accessible instruction with hands-on learning, we empower individuals with the tools they need to build a better future through education.
