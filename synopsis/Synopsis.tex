Upstride Education is a social-impact learning initiative dedicated to democratizing technology education for underserved communities. We offer comprehensive, free tech courses through our digital platform while conducting hands-on workshops in partnership with NGOs and community organizations.

Our mission is simple yet powerful: \textbf{to bridge the digital divide by providing quality tech education that empowers individuals with essential skills for the modern economy.}

    \item \textbf{Geographic Isolation:} Rural and underserved areas have minimal tech training opportunities
\end{itemize}

\textcolor{upstridegray}{\textit{Without intervention, these communities risk being left further behind in an increasingly digital world.}}
